# PokiiMap by KiiDev
(Yet another) Android app to help you san for pokemons in a map, because it's really important. 

Quick story, my wife had been obsessly playing PokemonGO since its release. I wrote this app mainly to help her play it. It's working pretty well so I decided to polish it a bit and contribute it back to the community. Download it if you like the game and hopefully it helps you. If you are a developer, fork it and join me build some awesome things before they start cracking down private API uses. 

To start, import it into android studio. Then get a goole map API key from google, add it to google_maps_api.xml. Build and have fun! (Messy codes warning)
